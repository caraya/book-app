# scapegoats versus solutions

I've fought to stay quiet over the insane violence we've deal with over the past few weeks. Two people killed by differente police departments and then 5 police officers killed by sniper fire from someone who claimed to do so in oposition to the black murders.

We use each other as scapegoats rather than come with solutions.

Some of the solutions we know we need are economical and political. How to lower violence in african american neighbors? How do we provide more opportunities so that people don't have to die needlessly in african american neighbors because of drive by shootings. Oakland comes to mind in terms of how many innocent people die because of gang/drug related violence. How do we make that change?

Some of the solutions are better training and screening of candidates for police forces in places where they've been problematic. The solution may be for members of the communities that have problems with the police actually join the orce. the attempt is more important to me than if they actually succeed... put your fucking money where your mouth is and it's a steady salary after all for someone to defend their neighbor against all threats (even threats from within.)

The solutions are not marches and declarations of war. they are not generalizing that all police officers murder, that all police officers rape, molest and condone such actions. I'm always willing to give the bennefit of the doubt but tweets like the one below from @jsfaq make it hard to remain objective.

To make it all better, Oakland PD (one of the police departments in California where lots of allegations have taken place) has a [mandatory overtime policy](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/05/12/oakland-police-officers-burnt-out-on-mandatory-overtime-as-city-reexamines-policy/) that has caused attrition not made up by recruitment and graduation from police academies. And, to be hones, who would want to work in a police department where people think you're automatically dirty just because you choose to wear the badge and the uniform?

> Some said the cost of overtime is ballooning. The overtime issue is scheduled for review on Tuesday with City Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan asking for a greater effort to fill vacant positions.

> “Our police officers, like any other human being, have a hard time working effectively when they’re expected to work double shifts and extra hours over and over again. Ultimately it undermines the public safety of the City of Oakland,” she said.

> Kaplan added that while the police academy is adding cops to the streets that the department loses five cops each month— mostly to retirements and resignations.

Something else I found deeply disturbing, come in two flavors...

One from someone I consider a friend... but, come on, are we falling to that level of paranoia? Do we really think that police departments, in addition to be murdererers, rapists and molesters and getting away with it, buy bombs to use against people because it was used to kill someone who had already murdered 5 people (police officers or not.) We all raise our voices for one use of the device but keep quiet when they are used all around the country to defuse explosives without risking lives, how many times do we hear about that?.... is it just me or the level of paranoia is getting to be too much?

Where do we draw the line? where do we say it's safe to confront an armed man versus findina  way to render him harmless or neutralize him? What's next? we let the paranoi grow even further to where the sound of a drone means that they are going to tear gas us from the air and we have no place to run? This is self imposed... few if any of the police officers I know would condone or participate in activities like these

and another one from a WNBA team, particularly the follow up discussion. SO showing favor to one side of the debate, just the 2 black men who died and ignoring 5 police officers who died in the line of duty is a good way to start change?

And we take refuge on video because it shows all the action and gives context to what happens, right? Because we should always believe slanted stories coming from both sides of the argument and never make up our own minds on the issues... right? Because a good editor can not change the perception of an event
